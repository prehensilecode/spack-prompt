Shell function to add Spack env name to prompt.

Based on [git-prompt.sh](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh)
by Shawn O. Pearce

This script allows you to see the active Spack environment in your prompt.

To enable:

1. Copy this file to somewhere (e.g. `~/.spack-prompt.sh`).
2. Add the following line to your .bashrc/.zshrc/.profile:
	- 	`. ~/.spack-prompt.sh   # dot path/to/this-file`
3. Change your `PS1` to call `__spack_ps1` as command-substitution:
   	-	Bash: `PS1='$(__spack_ps1 "{%s} ")[\u@\h \W]\$ '`
    -   ZSH:  `setopt PROMPT_SUBST ; PS1='$(__spack_ps1 "{%s} ")[%n@%m %c]\$ '`
       	-	the optional argument will be used as format string.
4. Alternatively, for a slightly faster prompt, `__spack_ps1` can
   be used for `PROMPT_COMMAND` in Bash or for `precmd()` in Zsh
   with two parameters, `pre` and `post`, which are strings
   you would put in `$PS1` before and after the status string
   generated by the spack-prompt machinery.  e.g.
   -	Bash: `PROMPT_COMMAND='__spack_ps1 "\u@\h:\w" "\\\$ "'.`
   -    ZSH: `precmd () { __spack_ps1 "%n" ":%~$ " "|%s" }`
   -	Optionally, you can supply a third argument with a printf
       	format string to finetune the output of the branch status
